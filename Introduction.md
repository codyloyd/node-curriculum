### What is Node.js?

You have no doubt noticed the popularity of Node.js.  There are many courses and articles about it around the net, installing it is a prerequisite for pretty much any front-end development work, and of course the amount of jobs that require knowledge of it has been steadily increasing for the past few years.

So what is it?  The [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) declares:

"As an asyncronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications."
This is a definition that requires a little unpacking.  

The important bit to understand right up front is that Node is a "JavaScript runtime".  When JavaScript was first invented, and for most of it's life (until the creation of Node) it has been a language that runs *in the browser*.  Node is a runtime that allows the user to run javascript code outside of the browser, on a command-line or in a server.  This allows developers to use JavaScript for pretty much anything that other popular server-side languages such as Ruby, PHP, C# and Python can do. So, at it's most basic, Node simply allows you to run JavaScript code on a machine such as your local computer or a server without having to go through a web-browser.

To facilitate this, Node has some added functionality that is not found in browser-based JS such as the ability to read and write files to the filesystem, create http connections and listen to network requests.

### Assignment

<div class="lesson-content__panel" markdown="1">
1. [This short module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps) on "The Server Side" from MDN is a great source of the background knowledge needed to understand what we're about to learn. Read through at least the first 2 the articles posted here under 'Guides': Introduction to the server side and Client-Server Overview. The other 2 are interesting and worth reviewing, but less relevant to our immediate concerns.
2. to gain a little more insight into the nature of Node, and to unpack the rest of the above definition, read [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5). There's a long, but *really* fantastic video linked in that article.. you should definitely watch it.
3. Take a minute or two to browse through the main [node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).  The getting-started article is a little *too* basic for our needs, and at this point the API documentation is probably a little too complicated for us to make use of just yet, but it will be useful to be familiar with this resource as we progress.
4. [This short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ) is a great introduction as well!
