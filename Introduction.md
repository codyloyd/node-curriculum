# Introduction: WHAT IS NODE

You have no doubt noticed the popularity of Node.js.  There are many courses and articles about it around the net, installing it is a prerequisite for pretty much any front-end development work, and of course the amount of jobs that require knowledge of it has been steadily increasing for the past few years.

So what is it?  The Node.js website [https://nodejs.org/en/about/](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) declares:

"As an asyncronous event driven JavaScript runtime, Node is designed to build scalable network applications."
This is a definition that requires a little unpacking.  

The important bit to understand right up front is that Node is a "JavaScript runtime".  When JavaScript was first invented, and for most of it's life (until the creation of Node) it has been a language that runs *in the browser*.  Node is a runtime that allows the user to run javascript code outside of the browser, on a command-line or in a server.  This allows developers to use JavaScript for pretty much anything that other popular server-side languages such as Ruby, PHP, C# and Python can do. So, at it's most basic, Node simply allows you to run JavaScript code on a machine such as your local computer or a server without having to go through a web-browser.

To facilitate this, Node has some added functionality that is not found in browser-based JS such as the ability to read and write files to the filesystem, create http connections and listen to network requests.

## Assignment

- This short module on "The Server Side" from MDN is a great source of the background knowledge needed to understand what we're about to learn. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps)  Read through at least the first 2 the articles posted here under 'Guides': Introduction to the server side and Client-Server Overview. The other 2 are interesting and worth reviewing, but less relevant to our immediate concerns.
- to gain a little more insight into the nature of Node, and to unpack the rest of the above definition, read this article: [https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-exactly-is-node-js-ae36e97449f5) (there's a long, but *really* fantastic video linked in that article.. you should definitely watch it)
- take a minute or two to browse through the main node.js website [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).  The getting-started article is a little *too* basic for our needs, and at this point the API documentation is probably a little too complicated for us to make use of just yet, but it will be useful to be familiar with this resource as we progress.
- This video is a quick, but great overview. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ)
